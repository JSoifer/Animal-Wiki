        <p>Here is some very interesting information about bears. Bears are very big and scary. They can kill you. Sometimes they are cute though, especially when they are babies. Baby bears are called cubs. Even though they are cute, you should not try to pet a bear cub.</p>

        <h2>Chickens!</h2>
        <p>Chickens are awesome. They eat bugs and worms and plants. They also eat chicken food. They lay eggs and walk around scratching at the ground and clucking. You can also kill them and eat them. If you are going to do that you should probably not name them things like "Pretty Sally", "Peaches" and "Mary Poopins".</p>
